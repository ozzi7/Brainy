# Brainy

A small asynchronous artificial neural network that can learn pattern recognition, memorization the XOR operator and others and trained using neuro-evolution.

## Neural Network Architecture
<!-- The neural network consists of neurons and axons which are loosely based on biological -->
### Neuron
<!--The neuron 
Has a refractory period which is important because edge delays can be arbitrarily close to 0 leading to a near infinite number of spikes making the calculation infeasible. -->
### Axon

### Network
<!-- Allowing self-loops (edges from nodes to themselves) decreased the maximum fitness in the identity experiment and are thus not allowed...  -->
